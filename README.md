# TipToiGui

Gui for the tttool from Joachim Breitner https://github.com/entropia/tip-toi-reveng
This program requires the tttool.exe to work fully functional.

The first thing you should do is to set up the tttool.exe in the TipToiGui. 
For this go to tttool > setup, choose the path to the tttool.exe, and hit the validate button. 
Now you should see the usage message from the tttool in the log box underneath.

After setting up, you can use the TipToiGui for a Gui driven helper to assemble your YAML files or create oid-code images.

You can also get started with a new project. 
Use the node editor to define your logics, use the graphics editor to arrange your graphics in a scene, apply polygon frames for your product-id and other oids. 
Finally, you are also able to export the scene in two pictures, one is your image arrangement, and the other ist the generated oid mask.

As a funny and maybe useful feature, you can also debug and play directly in the scene.
